# How to use this file:
#
# 1. Ensure that your local X11 server will allow remote clients. See
# xhost(1). If all else fails, `xhost +` will disable all access
# control, which can be acceptable if you trust your local network.
# Mac and Windows users, you're on your own...
# 2. Run this with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.cypress.yml up`
